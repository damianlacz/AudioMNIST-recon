# AudioMNIST-recon-gan

A practical usage of AudioMNIST dataset (https://github.com/soerenab/AudioMNIST) in reconstructing audio with autoencoders, generating new audio samples using GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) architecture and their possible use in deep learning, as well as trained neural network with PCA preprocessing.
